## About the project, brief description
The goal of this project is to create a more efficient version of the ISAP-1 (Improved Simple As Possible) computer, which has instructions encoded in 8 bits compared to the 4 bits in the case of the ISAP-1 computer.

The instruction set I want to contain the same instructions as the SAP-2 and SAP-3 computers, respectively the ISAP-2 and ISAP-3.

The Program Counter is 8-bit compared to the SAP-2 and SAP-3 computers and the ISAP-2 and ISAP-3 computers which have a 16-bit Program Counter.
