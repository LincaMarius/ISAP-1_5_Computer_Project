## About the project, brief description
The goal of this project is to create a more efficient version of the ISAP-1 (Improved Simple As Possible) computer, which has instructions encoded in 8 bits compared to the 4 bits in the case of the ISAP-1 computer.

The instruction set I want to contain the same instructions as the SAP-2 and SAP-3 computers, respectively the ISAP-2 and ISAP-3.

The Program Counter is 8-bit compared to the SAP-2 and SAP-3 computers and the ISAP-2 and ISAP-3 computers which have a 16-bit Program Counter.

## ISAP-1.5 version 1.0
The initial version I want to be a redesign of the ISAP-1 computer. To this end, we need to go through the steps that we followed to make that project happen.

Version 1.0 will be an implementation of the ISAP-1 computer that is as close to the original as possible. This will be the reference, the starting point for creating a better version.

### Step 1 – Block Diagram optimization
The first stage of any project is drawing the Block Diagram, which allows you to visualize the overall picture of the designed system, where you can see the component blocks and the connections between them.

The analysis of the Block Diagram of the ISAP-1 computer is the starting point for the creation of the ISAP-1.5 computer:
